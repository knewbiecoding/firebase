          So this is my first post on the site I created, hopefully to<br>
          bring together other individuals that are interested in coding.<br>
          I personally have been coding as a hobby for about 8 years. My<br>
          wife is a professional photographer and she needed a website so I<br>
          built my first website for her portfolio learning HTML/CSS. I <br>
          really enjoyed it and moved over into java and python. I'm not <br>
          claiming to be a professional by any means, but my goal is to make<br>
          a career change into coding and improve my skills in other lanuages<br>
          while helping others do the same. Please feel free to contact about <br>
          anything at the email address in the contact page.
